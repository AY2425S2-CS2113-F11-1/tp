# Busyness Manager

Busyness Manager is a CLI-based inventory system that will allow users to organise their products, track stock
levels, and compute revenue. Unlike generic inventory apps, there are plans to include Singapore-specific tax
calculations (e.g. Goods and Services Tax) and automatic low stock warnings.
