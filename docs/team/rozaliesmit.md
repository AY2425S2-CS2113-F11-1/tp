### New Features Implemented

- **Created the `SalesManager` class** to update sales transactions and manage inventory.
    - **What it does:** Updates sales transactions, decrements inventory and increases quantity sold, resets quantity sold through the `clear` command.
    - **Justification:** The application needs the ability to record sales transactions and update the inventory accordingly to effectively manage its transactions.
    - **Highlights:** This feature required synchronization of sales data and inventory levels, calling for validation of sales quantity and integration with the existing `InventoryManager` class to maintain consistency within the data.
